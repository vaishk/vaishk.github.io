								<li>Trisha, a mid-level manager, dreams of grandeur: a sprawling professional network, a close-knit family, corporate success and domestic bliss. Dev, next-in-line to CEO, hopes for total detachment from work and devises a cunning delegation system run by email-forwards.

							<h4>Chapter 1</h4>
							<p>Trisha made a conscious effort to retain only those aspects of her life that reflected well on her. To facilitate this, she frequently assessed all aspects of her life and made adjustments. It was her way of making sure that she lived a grand enviable life, full of grand enviable things, someday soon. After she read Dev's message, she knew she was due for another one of these adjustments. Dev's message to her was:</p>

							<p><i>Hey.. Sorry I won't be able to give you a ride to work today. I have that annual meeting thing I forgot to tell you about. Will reach work after lunch.</i></p>
							<p>She was taking a ride from him. But why?, she thought. She is no longer dating him, and more importantly, she is married to Sumir. Her carpooling with her boss might stir up bad gossip. She holds the exclusive attention of both Sumir and Dev today, and sure it feels good, but she can't go on this way, not at the risk of appearing unfaithful! It was nigh time for her to make the adjustment she should have made 2 months ago- The adjustment of removing those things that had reflected well on a free independent woman but don't reflect well on a woman who was also a wife. So today, sitting on the pot in her bathroom, she wanted to find a way to get rid of Dev and generally reflect on the way she conducts herself.</p>
