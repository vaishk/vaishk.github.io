## MEANS TO AN END
*By K Vaishali*

**Synopsis:** Trisha, a mid-level manager, dreams of grandeur: a sprawling professional network, a close-knit family, corporate success and domestic bliss. Dev, next-in-line to CEO, hopes for total detachment from work and devises a cunning delegation system run by email-forwards. Their circumstances are challenged when a looming organizational restructure forces them to re-evaluate their personal goals and their on-again-off-again relationship.
