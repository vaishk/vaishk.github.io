I want to tell someone my thoughts but I am all alone. I know this is transient, too. But it is as if I don't see the value of all this empty air around me, I have forgotten about oxygen. Soon enough, I will be gasping for this very air, like a child pushed into a swimming pool without warning. My college will begin in a few days too, and I know I will be suffocated with people around me then. But today is today and tomorrow will be later.
