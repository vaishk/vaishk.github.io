Here I have archived snippets from my diary that outlines the entire process:


### Realisation
*27 Aug 2012: Realisation*

I did this: [How to Discover your life purpose in about 20 minutes] [Life] 

Accordingly, the purpose of my life:
I want to be free. I want to lose myself, wandering aimlessly, exploring and admiring complexities. I want to experience things that I haven't experienced before. I want to find a place where I belong. I want to be an influential writer. 

The greatest lesson from this exercise is the realisation that I wanted to be a writer. I cried for the others too but not as hard. So writing is really what I want to do. Wow!

I don't know what to do with this piece of information. I feel like someone just told me my real name. So do I change my name right away or continue with what I believed was my name? Well it doesn't exactly apply because I can't really continue with what I am doing when I know what my purpose of life is. But when is the right time to start working on it? How soon is now?

It happens. Everyday I tell myself I will write a book on this person/that person. The last was yesterday night when I was thinking of a plot about a pizza delivery guy who lied to his employer about knowing every road in the locality. It was supposed to highlight the hopelessness that comes with living life and lying about knowing how to do it well. I am full of ideas. But I lack implementation. So much.

No I don't believe that. I probably will finish writing a book when I know it is the best I can write, and  that I am the best one to write it. Implementing an idea is complicated. I don't even know if I am a good writer. Well, I will try my best.


### I am a writer
*31 Aug 2013: Realisation sinks deeper*

Following a desire to shout out to the world that I am a writer, I thought it would be wise to pen this down:

**What is writing?**

Writing is scribbling as fast as you can think. Writing is a love letter. Writing is a memo. Writing is effortless and unconscious. Writing means knowing yourself. Writing also means knowing others. It is a flow. It is a giant flow of anything worth writing. It is eternal beauty. I don't know what writing is. I can only feel its power.

**What does it mean to be a writer?**

It means I get to do what I love doing most

**What do I hope to achieve as a writer?**

Happiness

**Why should I write?**

People tell me that when they read books they imagine themselves to be the protagonist. I find that ridiculous. I can never imagine myself as the protagonist in any novel. It would really narrow down my view of every other character, won't it? Why should I think of everyone from a single person's point of view? Why should I like what the protagonist likes and despise what they despise? I wondered for a while how it was that I read books, but it wasn't till I started reading Emma (by Jane Austen), that I understood my approach. I read books as the writer. I do. I get excited reading as I do writing when then protagonist is about to be brave or is about to break down or is about to be have a fight or is about to make love. I am so obsessed with writing styles and creative expression. With every scene I wonder what frame of mind the writer was in to have ended the book in a certain way while there were so many other possibilities. With every word I wonder - what was the writer thinking? What is the writer trying to do? It's crazy. I analyze and over-analyze. I secretly have little conversations with the writer, too. "Oh, Virginia Woolf how you idealize the life where you wake up in the morning to get flowers!" "Dostoyevsky, you really shouldn't torture your characters with so much of passion." "Gogol! You are making me cry with your brilliance!" and so on. I could be a hundred different characters while reading a book but even so, I choose to be a writer. I must be a writer then.

### Discipline
*5 Nov 2013: Enthusiasm*

I am surprised how often I am able to get that flow in writing when I write my novel. I get it almost every other night. All it took was strictness in tying myself down to do it. I can afford this much discipline. I almost recuire this much discipline.

This flow I talk of is the flow of my sub-conscious mind taking over my conscious mind. When this happens, I have access to knowledge I don't even know about consciously. I write and I read what I wrote and I swear I never know where any of it came about. I can think in ways I can't think if I try. It is marvellous. I am having fun writing this novel and all the insecurities I had about it are vanishing.

It feels like I am going the right way. I feel these days, the sun shines on me in the right way. I am probably in the right place then. I am finally starting to belong. All this is amazing. I feel like my life just started.

I am happy.

### I can't wait for people to read my book
*11 Jan 2014: More enthusiasm*

This is what an amazing life feels like. I love reading what I write. I can't believe a person can get so much satisfaction from doing something. I have been writing all my life but the way I feel about my novel is so much different from the way I feel about writing my blog. I don't know what it is or how to define it but I am incredibly happy. Someone could have thrown shit on my face today and I would still be very happy. That is how happy I am.

This is sorted then. I am surely going to make it as a writer. I am not sure why I need to make it or why I get so happy everytime I think of it but I will figure that out. It's not like that is everything I want or anything. I mean, yes, my whole life will change because of it. People will take me more seriously. I will be able to accomplish the things I want for this world faster and grander. I won't have to worry about things I don't care about and I will be independent and free to do whatever I please. So many reasons- and all of these are not even directly related to my profession. My life is going to change for the best.

Most of all, I can't wait for people to read my book. Not because I will be appreciated for it or anything but because my book could really make a difference in a person's life. My book's quirky little jokes will make people laugh. It will occupy the mind that wants to flee for a while from reality. It will give people things to think about. It will give them new prespective. I love my job.

I can't wait for it's release.


### It Will Happen
*23 May 2014: Before sending the first round of queries to agents*

My dreams of becoming an author can be fulfilled or shattered. I am not sure if I am ready for either.

What should I trust most in such a situation? My abilities? I really don't know. I guess I should let my work speak for me. But does a work really speak? God, I hope not. I never meant for it to speak to anyone. I meant for it to take form. Anyway, a little more of this and I am certainly going mad.

Sometimes I think things happen to make me feel a certain way that will make me do things differently. I don't feel like explaining that.

Tomorrow I will send it. Whatever 'it' is, it will happen.

### Rejection
*4 June 2014: First rejection*

An agent finally broke the silence.. with a rejection. Somehow I felt relieved that I got at least 5 minutes of his attention. But, hey, that's not right! Why do I feel like that?

This industry is making me feel like that. I was writing a big rant about it, but I guess it cooled off. I might finish it, though. This June is going to be the most uncertain month of my life. I am to decide what to do with this year- study or find some job, and minuter details thereof. Now I have to also decide how long and how far I am going to tolerate the traditional publishing bigotry. In other words- To self-publish or not? I am reading a guide to self-publishing. That, coupled with the experience I will have with literary agents this month should help me take a call by the end of June. As of now, I am bored, tired and pissed with them. I wish them good luck to sweep me off my feet.


### Rigorous Documentation of Hopes and Aspirations
*3 October 2014: After a round of rejections, before sending second round of queries*

I absolutely must finish the work I have left with MTAE (Means to an end). Once I go back to college, I am never going to find even breathing time, let alone time for sending mails to strangers. Anyway, I am almost done with the synopsis. I just have to tweak it a bit grammatically. Also, I have to read parts of the first 3 chapters and whole of the first 5 pages and make sure that I am still happy with its form and matter. Now finding out whether I will still remain happy or not might be something that I want to procrastinate. Why do you think I am writing this instead?

That maybe so, but I also have to document the hopes and aspirations I have before sending the second serious round of query letters to agents. I laughed hard at the previous sentence. What hopes and aspirations? I know too much. I don't have any innocence left to weave these hopes and aspirations with. I am doing this because this is something I should do before I try to do anything else. It is almost like burning the bridges except someone else is burning them to ensure that I don't get on it. And once all such bridges are burnt, I can perhaps find my own way or build my own bridge?

Well it really doesn't matter then, what the first 3 chapters or the synopsis reads like. Nobody is going to read them anyway. Everything is pointless.
