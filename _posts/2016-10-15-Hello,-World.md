My debut novel sees the li




My novel is out! 

This is my debut novel. I started writing it in August 2013; I finished it in May 2014. I signed a publishing deal in November 2015 and it was published last week (October 2016). 

I want to include snippets from my diary that documents the whole process.

### It Will Happen
*23 May 2014: Before sending the first round of queries to agents*

My dreams of becoming an author can be fulfilled or shattered. I am not sure if I am ready for either.

What should I trust most in such a situation? My abilities? I really don't know. I guess I should let my work speak for me. But does a work really speak? God, I hope not. I never meant for it to speak to anyone. I meant for it to take form. Anyway, a little more of this and I am certainly going mad.

Sometimes I think things happen to make me feel a certain way that will make me do things differently. I don't feel like explaining that.

Tomorrow I will send it. Whatever 'it' is, it will happen.

### Rigorus Documentation of Hopes and Aspirations
*3 October 2014: After a round of rejections, before sending second round of queries*

I absolutely must finish the work I have left with MTAE (Means to an end). Once I go back to college, I am never going to find even breathing time, let alone time for sending mails to strangers. Anyway, I am almost done with the synopsis. I just have to tweak it a bit grammatically. Also, I have to read parts of the first 3 chapters and whole of the first 5 pages and make sure that I am still happy with its form and matter. Now finding out whether I will still remain happy or not might be something that I want to procrastinate. Why do you think I am writing this instead?

That maybe so, but I also have to document the hopes and aspirations I have before sending the second serious round of query letters to agents. I laughed hard at the previous sentence. What hopes and aspirations? I know too much. I don't have any innocence left to weave these hopes and aspirations with. I am doing this because this is something I should do before I try to do anything else. It is almost like burning the bridges except someone else is burning them to ensure that I don't get on it. And once all such bridges are burnt, I can perhaps find my own way or build my own bridge?

Well it really doesn't matter then, what the first 3 chapters or the synopsis reads like. Nobody is going to read them anyway. Everything is pointless.
